//Run this rule last. Only if there are no DocumentNotOK facts for all our type will we say that our Income Documents are OK.
//We can't user insertLogical here, because the RFG node will retract the facts from WM when it's finished.
//This means that all matches are removed and thus the "DocumentsOK("incomce"))" fact will be removed from WM
// as well. This causes the gateway not to work because the gateway checks the presence of a fact in WM.
